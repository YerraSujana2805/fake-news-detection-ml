# Fake News Detection - ML Project

This is a simple Machine Learning project to classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake** using Logistic Regression and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TfidfVectorizer (NLP)
- Logistic Regression

## 📊 Dataset
We used a public dataset from Kaggle/online sources with real and fake news articles.

## 🚀 How it works:
1. Load news dataset
2. Vectorize text using TF-IDF
3. Train a Logistic Regression model
4. Evaluate model accuracy

## 🔍 Sample Output
